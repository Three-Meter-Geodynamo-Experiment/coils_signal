function [voltage] = coils_signal(I,var_type)
%COILS_SIGNAL returns average voltage on 33 probes that comes from external coils
%   type corresponds to the configuration of the external field
%   1 - one coil: stationary sphere experiment: 050914 with magnetic ramp with one external coil
%   2 - two coils dipolar north up:  032516 ro = 0, fo=4, I ~ 20 and I = 0;  200 Amps that day don't look good, 
%   3 - two coils quadrupolar equator north: based on 032416 with -3.7 Hz and three mag fields with I = 0 20 170
%   4 - two coils dipolar north up:  082616 ro = 0, fo = 0.2, mag ramp up to 170, don't like this cuz the phi probe linearly depend ons current
